# 🏆 MindChain: The Ultimate Mental Wellness Platform (Hackathon Roadmap)

MindChain is an AI-powered mental health ecosystem designed to provide proactive support, gamified wellness, and community-driven healing. This roadmap aims to transform it into a category-winning hackathon entry.

## 🚀 Phase 1: Core Experience (MVP) - *Solidify the Foundation*
- [ ] **Unified Dashboard:** Create a central "Command Center" showing mood trends, streak status, and recommended actions.
- [ ] **AI Companion (V1):** 
    - [ ] Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) so the AI remembers previous journal entries for long-term context.
    - [ ] Add "Actionable Insights" - AI suggests a breathing exercise or a specific community group based on chat sentiment.
- [ ] **Smart Journaling:**
    - [ ] Real-time sentiment analysis after saving. 
    - [ ] Mood-based color shifts in the UI.
- [ ] **Gamification (V1):**
    - [ ] Implement "MindCoins" rewards for check-ins, journaling, and breathing.
    - [ ] Daily streak system with visual confetti celebrations.

## ✨ Phase 2: The "Wow" Factor - *Hackathon Winning Features*
- [ ] **🎙️ Voice-to-Mind Interaction:**
    - [ ] Real-time voice chat with the AI Companion using Web Speech API or ElevenLabs for empathetic voice synthesis.
    - [ ] Voice journaling with auto-transcription and sentiment tagging.
- [ ] **🌱 The "MindGarden":**
    - [ ] A 3D/SVG interactive garden that grows/blooms based on the user's mental health activities (using Three.js or Framer Motion).
    - [ ] If a user misses a check-in, the plants "wilt" slightly to nudge them back.
- [ ] **🔮 Predictive Well-being:**
    - [ ] Use AI to predict potential "Burnout Risk" based on patterns in journal entries and check-ins over 7 days.
    - [ ] Proactive alerts: "You've been feeling stressed for 3 days; would you like to try a 5-minute deep breathing session?"
- [ ] **🤝 Collaborative Healing (Communities):**
    - [ ] Anonymous support groups with "Safety Shields" (AI-moderated chat to prevent toxic behavior).
    - [ ] Shared "Group Challenges" (e.g., "7 days of mindfulness together").

## 🎨 Phase 3: UX/UI & Aesthetic Polish - *The Visual Edge*
- [ ] **Theme Personalization:** OKLCH-based dynamic themes that adapt to the user's current mood (Blue for calm, Yellow for happy, Purple for focus).
- [ ] **Advanced Data Viz:**
    - [ ] Interactive "Emotional Heatmap" showing mood peaks throughout the week.
    - [ ] "Soul Map" - A word cloud or visual representation of the user's most used emotional keywords.
- [ ] **Micro-interactions:** 
    - [ ] Haptic-like visual feedback on buttons.
    - [ ] Smooth page transitions using Framer Motion (already in project, needs optimization).
    - [ ] Skeleton loaders for all AI-generated content.

## 🛠️ Phase 4: Technical Excellence - *Reliability & Performance*
- [ ] **Offline Mode (PWA):** Ensure basic journaling and breathing exercises work without an internet connection.
- [ ] **Accessibility (A11y):** Full screen-reader support, high-contrast mode, and keyboard-navigable UI.
- [ ] **Speed Optimization:** 
    - [ ] Edge runtime for API routes.
    - [ ] Optimistic updates in Convex for instant UI feedback.
- [ ] **Security:** End-to-end encryption for private journal entries (using Web Crypto API).

## 📝 Hackathon Submission Checklist
- [ ] **Killer README:** Clear value proposition, tech stack diagram, and setup instructions.
- [ ] **Demo Video:** A 2-minute high-energy walkthrough showing the "MindGarden" and AI Voice Chat.
- [ ] **Pitch Deck:** Focus on "Why now?" and the impact on mental health accessibility.
